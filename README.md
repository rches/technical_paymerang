## Journal Notes

2/7/2020 - React seems like the best place to be for this project. I have a comfort level with React that allows me to hit the ground running and ignore having to relearn a different framework. It also has the tools to make the task simpler and more enjoyable to work on (easy coding is happy coding).

2/8/2020 - Sketched out a few ideas fro the sake of clarity. Getting a battle plan ready really is a weakness and something I'm mindful of with this project. A lightbulb went off when trying to tie the navigation to what is being displayed: React is the right tool because of state. State will allow the display and nav tying together to be WAY easier and intuitive.

Note to self - the pagination is just a navbar with some math involved: don't overthink it!
