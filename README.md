## Journal Notes

2/7/2020 - React seems like the best place to be for this project. I have a comfort level with React that allows me to hit the ground running and ignore having to relearn a different framework. It also has the tools to make the task simpler and more enjoyable to work on (easy coding is happy coding).

2/8/2020 - Sketched out a few ideas fro the sake of clarity. Getting a battle plan ready really is a weakness and something I'm mindful of with this project. A lightbulb went off when trying to tie the navigation to what is being displayed: React is the right tool because of state. State will allow the display and nav tying together to be WAY easier and intuitive.

General notes from the day:

-   Note to self - the pagination is just a navbar with some math involved: don't overthink it!

-   I'm not smart with math, so getting the logic for number of pages and for each page was tricky.

-   Really had to walk back ou tof possible rabbit holes like "what about loading all the data on the client side?, will this code be able to stand up over time?, Is this data secure or should I think about security in this challenge?"

2/9/2020 - The logic to pass the array of object tied me up for a bit. Thinking logically through what part of the entire project should handle iterrating what parts of the data took a bit longer than hoped, but after some trial and error, we managed to parse it out. Moving on to styling the components. If there is time, will consider sort functions to make the data manageable.
